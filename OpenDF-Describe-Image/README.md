# image classification using pre-trained models

This contains code and weights files for the following Keras models:

- VGG16
- VGG19
- ResNet50

This source can be used with both Theano and Tensoflow backends, and upon instantiation the models will be built according to the image dimension ordering set in your Keras configuration file at `~/.keras/keras.json`. For instance, if you have set `image_dim_ordering=tf`, then any model loaded from this repository will get built according to the TensorFlow dimension ordering convention, "Width-Height-Depth".

Weights will be automatically loaded upon instantiation. If weights are unavailable in the source it will be automatically downloaded, and cached locally in `~/.keras/models/`.

## How ro Install
```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Change Directory to `src`

For VGG16 model
```sh
$ python main.py --model VGG16 --image "Path to image"
```

For VGG19 model
```sh
$ python main.py --model VGG19 --image "Path to image"
```

For ResNet50 model
```sh
$ python main.py --model ResNet50 --image "Path to image"
```
